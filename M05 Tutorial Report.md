I have successfully completed each step of this tutorial! Included in this repository are 10 images showing the progress I made to my blog along the way. The code I pushed to github during this assignment is located in my repoitory 'my-first-blog'.

This tutorial was much, much longer than I expected, so I will unfortunately be posting this assignment to IvyLearn a few hours late.
